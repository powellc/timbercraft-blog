We started in on a new server about a month ago. It started out on an experimental platform
in the basement that was a SmartOS server with a NodeJS zone running inside of it. Pretty 
slick, but when mincrafted.net had an offer for a 2G VPS, the option to host with real
bandwidth and not the paltry stuff Time Warner hands out, I jumped.

So far it's just been two of us occupying the world. I've pioneered a new diamond mining
technique (new to me). Instead of getting lost in naturally occuring caves. I just tunnel
straight down to the 10-16 range and assume I can under-build my way out later. Then I go 
straight out in one direction until my pickaxe gives up the ghost or I get bored. At that
point I turn around and go all the way back, block up that tunnel, turn 90 degrees and start
in on another straight tunnel.

One of the interesting side-effects of this technique is that you frequently run into your
own tunnels underground when you start a new deep hole. So even though you feel as though
your venturing into an unknown world, you've likely been there before. So it goes mining
at a consistent level 12.

Another caveat to that technique is to always stay true to the "mine in a straight line"
rule. If you find a cavern or an old tunnel of yours, don't get distracted, just keep plowing
ahead. If you really want to explore the cavern, go back home, dump your loot, prepare for
a long adventure, and go back. But never just wander into a cavern without taking stock
of what you've got and whether you're okay losing it if a spider knocks you into some lava.
